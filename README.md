# chat_server_multi_client
This Git repository contains a multi-client chat server implemented in C using sockets and pthreads. The server supports multiple clients connecting simultaneously, each able to send and receive messages in a simple chat environment. Clients are identified by their usernames, and the server forwards messages between clients in real-time. The code is structured to handle multiple client connections efficiently using threads and mutex locks to ensure thread safety. It's a practical example of socket programming for a basic chat application, suitable for learning and experimentation with network programming concepts in C.
